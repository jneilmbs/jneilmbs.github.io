# myFCCcode

Welcome to my Free Code Camp working diary of sorts where I'll be sharing my new coding skills as well as a few notes for future reference(s).  I'm not only looking forward to acquiring my Full Stack Developer certification and the many doors it will open but, I am moreso excited about paying it forward to the non-profit community whilst creating a series of software solutions for one of the many in-need organizations.  That's a WIN-WIN in my book!  For more information check out http://www.freecodecamp.com.
